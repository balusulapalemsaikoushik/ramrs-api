### How are clues updated?

After an initial draft database has been [generated](https://github.com/balusulapalemsaikoushik/clue-classifier), a select team of moderators delete unwanted clues and edit incomplete ones from their dashboard. A script to update clues based on new question sets is currently in the works.
